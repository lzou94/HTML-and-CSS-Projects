	<p>Cats. Fluffy, furry, and sometimes affectionate. Although, most cat owners can agree that cats are mostly just assholes. Whether its knocking over cups or killing innocent plants, cats tend to just do whatever they want <a src= "https://cats.lovetoknow.com/image/168266~grumpy-cat.jpg">(and when they can't they look like this.)</a> It's almost as if the world made dogs to be man's best friend while they made cat's to be man's biggest annoyance. Yet somehow, we still keep them as pets because even though they frustrate the hell out of us, there's just something endearing about how they treat us. Today we will be exploring the reasons as to why cats are just assholes. <a href= "lostcat.html">Click here to see a cat who fooled his parents</a>

							A new study from the University of Tokyo has confirmed this, showing that although pet cats are more than capable of recognising their ownerâ€™s voice they choose to ignore them - for reasons that are perhaps rooted in the evolutionary history of the animal.
